I feel the sunlight on my head
The scent of summer in my bed
When we were footprints in the sand
Stealing liquor, making plans
I can see your face from miles and miles away
But heaven knows it's gonna fade, heaven knows it's gonna fade
I’m a dog searching for reasons and a way
Back to your hands, you make me tremble, make me crash
Forget my name
And just ride that wave until we’re higher than life
With the sun in our eyes
Yeah, just ride on that cloud until we fall from the sky
No tears for the night, for the night
For the night
Yeah, just ride that wave until we’re higher than life
With the sun in our eyes
They said to watch out for your kind
I watched out and it blew my mind, yeah
They say that romance makes you blind
Well, I’ll be blinded for a lifetime
But I can see your face from miles and miles away
And I remember every kiss, all the games you had me play
I’m a dog searching for answers and a way
Back to your hands, you made me tremble, made me crash
Forget my name
And just ride that wave until we’re higher than life
With the sun in our eyes
Yeah, just ride on that cloud until we fall from the sky
No tears for the night, for the night (for the night, for the night)
For the night (for the night, for the night)
Yeah, just ride that wave until we’re higher than life
With the sun in our eyes
Lala lala lala lala la
Lala lala lala lala la
With the sun in our eyes
Lala lala lala lala la
Lala lala lala lala la
Ey, I can see your face from miles and miles away
But heaven knows it's gonna fade, heaven knows it's gonna fade
I’m a dog searching for answers and a way
Back to your hands, you make me tremble, make me crash
Forget my name
And just ride that wave until we’re higher than life
With the sun in our eyes
Yeah, just ride on that cloud until we fall from the sky (until we fall from the sky)
No tears for the night, for the night (for the night, for the night)
For the night (one more time)
Yeah, just ride that wave until we’re higher than life
With the sun in our eyes
