Yeah, yeah
I got this vision in my mind
You got me sinning with desire
You got my heart on double time
And I’m not putting out this fire
Call me anytime that you want
Send for, me you know I’ll come over
Hit me when you’re ready to go
Love me 'cause I like and I want ya
Ooh put put put put it on me
Woman woman woman woman woman
Wants you bad
‘Cause I like it when you touch me (I don’t know where to begin)
Do nasty things and you don’t judge me (say it again and again)
You got that something that undoes me (I want you over, over, over, over and over)
There’s nothing wrong with being bad
You know that’s what you like about me
Just run your fingers down my back
Go head and feel up on my body, ooh baby
Because I’m owning what’s mine
Confident I know, I look good babe
Hope that you can handle my shine
Love me in the way that you should babe
Ooh put put put put it on me
Woman woman woman woman woman
Wants you bad
‘Cause I like it when you touch me (I don’t know where to begin)
Do nasty things and you don’t judge me (say it again and again)
You got that something that undoes me (I want you over, over, over, over and over)
Love me
Just make me love me, love me
Touch me
I wanna feel you on me
I want you over my skin
Say it again and again (I want you over my skin)
‘Cause I like it when you touch me (I don’t know where to begin)
Do nasty things and you don’t judge me (say it again and again)
You got that something that undoes me (I want you over, over, over, over and over)
I want you over my skin
